## Getting Started with `go-api-sdk-jamfpro`

This guide will help you **GET** started with `go-api-sdk-jamfpro`, a Go SDK for interfacing with Jamf Pro.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Go installed and set up on your system. If not, follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Installation

Install the `go-api-sdk-jamfpro` package using `go get`:

```bash
go **GET** github.com/deploymenttheory/go-api-sdk-jamfpro
```

## Usage

sample code: [examples](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/go-jamfpro-api/tree/main/examples)

## Configuring the HTTP Client

To effectively use the `go-api-sdk-jamfpro` SDK, you'll need to set up and configure the HTTP client. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Setting Constants

At the start of your main program, you can optionally define define some constants that will be used to configure the client for http client. If you don't set any then defaults from `shared_api_client.go` will be used.

```go
const (
	maxConcurrentRequestsAllowed = 5 // Maximum allowed concurrent requests.
	defaultTokenLifespan         = 30 * time.Minute
	defaultBufferPeriod          = 5 * time.Minute
)
```

These constants are used to set the maximum number of concurrent requests the client can make, the lifespan of the token, and a buffer period.

2. Loading OAuth Credentials
The http client for this SDK supports both classic auth and Oauth with bearer token. Since the direction of travel is Oauth, in this example store your credentials in a JSON file for secure and easy access. The structure of the client auth json should be like this:

```json
{
  "instanceName": "your_jamf_instance_name", // Required
  "clientID": "your_client_id", // Required
  "clientSecret": "your_client_secret", // Required
  "overrideBaseDomain": "optional_custom_domain.com" // Optional field
}
```

Replace your_jamf_instance_name, with your jamf pro instance name. e.g for mycompany.jamfcloud.com , use "mycompany".
Replace your_client_id, and your_client_secret with your actual credentials.

In your Go program, load these credentials using:

```go
configFilePath := "path_to_your/clientauth.json"
authConfig, err := http_client.LoadClientAuthConfig(configFilePath)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Failed to load client OAuth configuration: %v", err)
}
```

3. Configuring the HTTP Client
With the OAuth credentials loaded, you can now configure the HTTP client:

```go
// Initialize a new default logger
logger := http_client.NewDefaultLogger()

// Set the desired log level on the logger
logger.SetLevel(http_client.LogLevelInfo) // LogLevel can be None, Warning, Info, or Debug

// Create the configuration for the HTTP client with the logger
config := http_client.Config{
	Logger: logger,
}
```

The Logger uses the SDK's default logger.

4. Initializing the Jamf Pro Client
Once the HTTP client is configured, initialize the Jamf Pro client:

```go
client := jamfpro.NewClient(authConfig.InstanceName, config)
```

Then, set the OAuth credentials for the client's HTTP client:

```go
oAuthCreds := http_client.OAuthCredentials{
	ClientID:     authConfig.ClientID,
	ClientSecret: authConfig.ClientSecret,
}
client.HTTP.SetOAuthCredentials(oAuthCreds)
```

With these steps, the HTTP client will be fully set up and ready to make requests to the Jamf Pro API. You can then proceed to use the client to perform various actions as demonstrated in the sample code provided.

Note: Remember to always keep your OAuth credentials confidential and never expose them in your code or public repositories.

### URL Construction in the Client

The `go-api-sdk-jamfpro` SDK constructs URLs in a structured manner to ensure consistent and correct API endpoint accesses. Here's a breakdown of how it's done:

#### **Instance Name:**
The primary identifier for constructing URLs in the client is the `InstanceName` which represents the Jamf Pro instance. For example, for the URL `mycompany.jamfcloud.com`, the instance name would be `mycompany`.

#### **Base Domain:**
If OverrideBaseDomain is provided during http client initialization, this will override jamfcloud.com and will be used as the base domain for URL construction. Otherwise, the default domain defined in the http_client package (jamfcloud.com) will be used.

URL Construction in the Client
URLs are constructed using the InstanceName and, optionally, the OverrideBaseDomain. If the OverrideBaseDomain is not specified, the default domain (jamfcloud.com) is used. The SDK automatically appends this domain to the InstanceName for API calls.

```go
const (
	BaseDomain     = ".jamfcloud.com"
)
```

#### **Endpoint Path:**
Each API function in the SDK corresponds to a specific Jamf Pro API endpoint. The SDK appends this endpoint path to the constructed domain to derive the full URL.

#### **URL Construction Example:**
Given the `InstanceName` as `mycompany` and an endpoint path `/JSSResource/accounts/userid/{id}`, the full URL constructed by the client would be:
```
https://mycompany.jamfcloud.com/JSSResource/accounts/userid/{id}
```

#### **Customizability:**
The SDK is designed to be flexible. While it uses the `jamfcloud.com` domain by default, this can be updated to meet your requiremesnt for your environment.

### **Note:**
Always ensure that the `InstanceName` is correctly set when initializing the client. Avoid including the full domain (e.g., `.jamfcloud.com`) in the `InstanceName` as the SDK will automatically append it.

Putting it all together

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/deploymenttheory/go-api-sdk-jamfpro/sdk/http_client" // Import http_client for logging
	"github.com/deploymenttheory/go-api-sdk-jamfpro/sdk/jamfpro"
)

func main() {
	// Define the path to the JSON configuration file
	configFilePath := "/path/to/your/clientauth.json"

	// Load the client OAuth credentials from the configuration file
	authConfig, err := jamfpro.LoadClientAuthConfig(configFilePath)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to load client OAuth configuration: %v", err)
	}

	// Instantiate the default logger and set the desired log level
	logger := http_client.NewDefaultLogger()
	logLevel := http_client.LogLevelInfo // LogLevelNone // LogLevelWarning // LogLevelInfo  // LogLevelDebug

	// Configuration for the jamfpro
	config := jamfpro.Config{
		InstanceName:       authConfig.InstanceName,
		OverrideBaseDomain: authConfig.OverrideBaseDomain,
		LogLevel:           logLevel,
		Logger:             logger,
		ClientID:           authConfig.ClientID,
		ClientSecret:       authConfig.ClientSecret,
	}

	// Create a new jamfpro client instance
	client, err := jamfpro.NewClient(config)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create Jamf Pro client: %v", err)
	}
}
```
